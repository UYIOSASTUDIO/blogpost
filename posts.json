Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring.[19] Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.[20][21]\n\nWe [Anonymous] just happen to be a group of people on the Internet who need—just kind of an outlet to do as we wish, that we wouldn't be able to do in regular society. ...That's more or less the point of it. Do as you wish. ... There's a common phrase: 'we are doing it for the lulz.'\n— Trent Peacock, Search Engine: The Face of Anonymous, February 7, 2008.[22]\nBecause Anonymous has no leadership, no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole."
